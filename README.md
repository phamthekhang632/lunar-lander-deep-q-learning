Moon Landing using Deep Q-Learning
==
This is the final project for MMAE500 - Data-Driven Modeling: an introduction to machine learning class.

The project implements Deep Q-learning to control the landing of a space shuttle in the [Lunar Lander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) environment from Farama-Foundation's Gymnasium (previously OpenAI's Gym).

You can find my final report [here](MMAE500_ProjectReport.pdf).
